# HW03C Description
Disclaimer: I was not able to successfully complete this assignment.
1. I defined the circle and line counts, and created random circles using a for loop. 
2. I tried to figure out how to connect the latter part of the line to the new randomly created circle, but I was not able to figure out how to do so in time.
