# HW03C Description
**Correction**  
Thanks to the extra time and advice I was able to complete this assignment.  
1. I defined how many 'battons' I want to create. Each batton is comprised of 2 circles and one line.
2. Since we were told to think of this as 50 points. 
3. Each pair connected by a line, that leaves us with 25 'battons'. Because the numbers count ffrom 0, I set the batton count to 24.
4. The for loop generates random values to define the positions of the circles, as well as both ends of the lines to correspond with the center of the respective circle.
  
  
  
**OLD** Disclaimer: I was not able to successfully complete this assignment.
1. I defined the circle and line counts, and created random circles using a for loop. 
2. I tried to figure out how to connect the latter part of the line to the new randomly created circle, but I was not able to figure out how to do so in time.
